## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location


⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️: To use the IP Geolocation API by IPify, you'll need to sign up for a free account. You won't need to add any cards details to do this and it's a very quick process. This will generate an API Key for you. Usually, you would be able to restrict your API Key to a specific URL (your own domain). This makes sure that other people can't use your API Key on their own websites. IPify doesn't have this feature, but because you aren't adding your card details, this isn't an issue. **So be sure to only sign up for the free account and DO NOT enter any card details**.

For the mapping API, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/). It's free to use and doesn't require an API Key. If you decide to use another API, like Google Maps or Mapbox, be sure to secure your API Key. Here are guides for both Google Maps and Mapbox, be sure to read through them thoroughly:

- [API Key best practices from Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/maps/api-key-best-practices)
- [How to use Mapbox securely](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/how-to-use-mapbox-securely/)

Exposing your API Key publicly can lead to other people using it to make requests for their own application if the proper precautions aren't in place. Please be sure you read the guides thoroughly and follow their recommendations.
